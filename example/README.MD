# structured-log NodeJS Server-side Example

This example is a very simple example shows setup and usage of *structured-log* in NodeJS.

To run you first need to have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) installed.

The change directory to where the example is (where this *readme* is): 

	cd examples/nodejs 

Then run the script using NodeJS:

	node server.js

You should now see examples of logging that were output from *server.js*.
